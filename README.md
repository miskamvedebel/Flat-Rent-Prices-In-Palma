# Flat-Rent-Prices-In-Palma
Rental prices for flats in Palma de Mallorca

Getting the data from https://www.idealista.com/

The idea of this project is to check whether changes that has been done by Palma de Mallorca goverment in early August of 2017 made impact on availability and pricing of flats for rent.

**background**: as Palma is one of the biggest summer destination in Europe, it's more profitable for owners to rent their flats weekly/daily, so-called 'vacational' business. Due to this, there is lack of flats on the long-term rent market, as result - prices are very high.
In August 2017 - goverment of Palma made changes in rental laws, making it more difficult for owners. 

**My goal** is to evaluate whether changes that has been introduced made impact.
**Assumption** - more flats should be available on the market, as result - prices should go down.
